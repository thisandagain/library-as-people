### Mission
Libraries are catalysts for individual success and civic engagement that provide a trusted and persistent context to our world, our communities, and to ourselves. They do this by creating linkages between the past, present, and future. These linkages take a variety of forms, and extend beyond the book to include media, tools, people, and even communities themselves. The institution of libraries must embrace creativity and flexibility to remain a relevant engine of social good and the individual pursuit of happiness.

Information is becoming more abundant while the means of production are becoming more accessible. This is opening new channels for the sharing and the distribution of knowledge outside of traditionally held forms. The ability to exploit these means of production now becomes the new "literacy". The institution of the library is uniquely positioned to provide access, skills, context, and trusted platforms for sharing in this new society.

### Approach

**Specialize**

From a human perspective, libraries will need to evolve the competencies necessary to fully engage with the new realities of civil society. This includes boosting skill-sets such as digital literacy, but also necessitates developing deep institutional knowledge of the technical context in which our society now exists. We recognize however, that continuously expanding the roles and responsibilities of the librarian is neither sustainable or in the long term interest of the institution. Rather, specialization is needed with a focus on maximizing the ability for human capital within the institution to engage with patrons. It is through this engagement that the values and assets within each library can be most fully realized and leveraged by society.

**Unify**

Central to maximizing the enormous value contained within the institution is pursuing opportunities for eliminating workloads which do not directly impact patrons and communities at large. Many of these opportunities can be found within increased unification between library systems and branches. This includes pursuing increased knowledge transfer throughout all levels of the institution, as well as the modernization and consolidation of infrastructure.

**Focus**

Libraries role at the center of civil society has put pressure on the institution to take on increasingly more broad responsibilities within many communities. As with any organization, it is essential to the long term health and stability of libraries to maintain a focus on core competencies where the most value is provided to society at large. This necessitates thorough evaluation and vetting at the system and branch level to ensure that library resources are leveraged most effectively.

**Communicate**

The profound affect that libraries are having on individuals and communities throughout society is not a story that is being told. A strong and unified voice is required to tell these stories in a way which connects with all aspects of civil society. This includes narratives of personal transformation, community interaction, economic development, and even stories of the library's impact on democracy itself.

Communication as a means to drive patronage is not enough. The library must exude it's principles in order to attract individuals critical to developing a 21st century workforce. These values, combined with an improved social consciousness are furthermore critical to developing strong relationships with other public and private institutions.

**Reflect**

The library is a distributed platform which touches an incredibly diverse range of communities. The individual affordances within each of these communities need to be explored and fully leveraged at the local level. These affordances are spread across a vast landscape. Prototypes are as diverse as taking advantage of a huge number of Pulitzer Prize winning authors in Brooklyn to form writing workshops, to using cheap and available manufacturing infrastructure in Detroit to build makerspaces.

**Evaluate**

Any proposed pathway for strengthening an institution as vast and diverse as the library will ultimately fail without meaningful mechanisms for feedback. Both qualitative and quantitative means for assessing the performance of libraries at both the system and branch level must be implemented.

### Manifestations

**Physical**

The physical library must undergo a transition which embraces a new understanding of literacy and provides the flexibility needed to be able to thrive in a world which now changes at an ever more rapid pace. Central to this flexibility is creating spaces which can be adapted by individuals and communities to enhance the libraries value to society.

**Virtual**

The library as it exists within virtual space must be considered as a wholly independent but highly integrated experience. Platforms must be conceived which not only address the operational and practical benefits of libraries, but also those which are emotional and highly social. 

An open and federated platform should exist which allows society to actively contribute back to the library. A "lending library" platform could bring branches back to their roots as an institution "for the people and by the people" which is all the more relevant in a society increasingly dominated by the creation and distribution of media.
